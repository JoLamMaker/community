# eduncan911 mods

Our Lite3DP will be heavily used by our kids, as well as demostrations at a local school for STEM experiements.

Therefore, the mods I have are to better the device for use with kids, as well as reliability, and most of all usability.

As I release my mods, I will update this README with an index.

- [/carriage-v2](./carriage-v2) is an overhauled carriage with a number of improvements.
